# Trip-Duration-Prediction
Predict taxi trip durations in NYC using a Ridge Regression model. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and spatial clustering with MiniBatchKMeans. The model estimates trip durations based on pickup/dropoff locations, distances, and temporal features. Performance is evaluated using RMSE and R-squared metrics.
